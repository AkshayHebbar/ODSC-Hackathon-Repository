# ODSC West 2024 Hackathon with NVIDIA

Welcome to the central repository for the ODSC West 2024 Hackathon with NVIDIA!

‚ùî For more information on the hackathon itself, check out [this webpage](https://odsc.com/california/hackathon/) or [this FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jhw9V79gxOr8tGxkIN-hEkiN9htXye7ev0IRYoT8uEc/edit?tab=t.0). ‚ùî

## Overview of the Hackathon:

Your goal in this Hackathon is to train `google/gemma-2-2b` using PEFT LoRA on a legal tag-classification task. You'll be using the [Law-StackExchange](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ymoslem/Law-StackExchange) as the base dataset for this task.

You will use [NeMo Curator](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Curator) to curate data and [NeMo FW](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo) to customize it and then evaluate your model!

You are free to: 
- Modify training hyperparameters
- Modify, Augment (with SDG, etc) the training dataset
- Modify the NeMo Curator curation pipeline

Your (or your team's) scores will be based on multi-class F1 scores, determined by comparing your generated predictions on the submission dataset against the held-out labels. In the event of tiebreaks, we will refer to the scoring rubric available [here](#NEED_LINK)

## Overview of this Repository

The repository will guide you through a boilerplate example of NeMo Curator curation pipelines and NeMo FW customization, model loading, and inference.

There are a total of three Jupyter Notebooks to work through:

1. [Data Curation](https://github.com/chrisalexiuk-nvidia/ODSC-Hackathon-Repository/blob/main/step-1-data-curation.ipynb)
  - This notebook will take you through the downloading, processing, and then curating the target dataset
2. [Downloading the Model](https://github.com/chrisalexiuk-nvidia/ODSC-Hackathon-Repository/blob/main/step-2-download-model.ipynb)
  - This notebook will download the model and convert it to a NeMo FW compatible format
3. [Training a LoRA Adapter](https://github.com/chrisalexiuk-nvidia/ODSC-Hackathon-Repository/blob/main/step-3-training.ipynb)
  - This notebook will walkthrough how to fine-tune the model using PEFT LoRA, and then how to generate submission responses

## Deliverables

You must submit (according to [this form](#NEED_FORM)) in a *SINGLE* Google Drive:

1. Your predicted tag submission `.JSONL` file.
2. Your LoRA Adapters
3. Your notebooks (with outputs)
4. A 3min. Loom video explaining your process (code walkthrough not required).

## Conclusion

Have fun! üéâ
